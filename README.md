# ✈️ Power BI Project: Airlines Flight Delay Analysis

This project uses **Power BI** to analyze flight delay data from major airlines. It aims to identify the causes, patterns, and frequency of delays, helping stakeholders understand operational inefficiencies and improve on-time performance.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To create an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that:
- Visualizes flight delay trends across airlines, routes, and time
- Identifies top causes of delays (weather, carrier, security, etc.)
- Provides insights to help airlines reduce delays and improve service quality
